/** @page release-3-7-0 Release 3.7.0 (Master)

%Taskflow 3.7.0 is the newest developing line to new features and improvements 
we continue to support.
It is also where this documentation is generated.
Many things are considered @em experimental and may change or break from time to time.
While it may be difficult to be keep all things consistent when introducing new features, 
we continue to try our best to ensure backward compatibility.
